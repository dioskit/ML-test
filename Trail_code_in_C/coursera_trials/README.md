# REGRESSION (_linear_)
# Steps for Implementing Linear Regression

## 1. Prepare the Data:
- **Input**: A dataset with input features \(x\) and the corresponding target values \(y\).
- Normalize or standardize the features, if necessary, to speed up convergence.

## 2. Initialize Parameters:
- Start with initial values for the model parameters (weights \(w\) and bias \(b\)). Typically, they are set to small random values or zero.

## 3. Define the Hypothesis Function (Prediction):
- For simple linear regression:
  \[
  \hat{y} = w \cdot x + b
  \]
- For multiple linear regression (if there are multiple input features):
  \[
  \hat{y} = w_1 \cdot x_1 + w_2 \cdot x_2 + \cdots + w_n \cdot x_n + b
  \]
  where \(w\) represents the weights and \(x\) represents the features.

## 4. Define the Cost Function (Mean Squared Error):
The cost function measures how well the model predicts the target:
\[
J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( \hat{y}_i - y_i \right)^2
\]
where:
- \(m\) is the number of training examples.
- \(\hat{y}_i\) is the predicted value for the i-th example.
- \(y_i\) is the actual value for the i-th example.
## 5. Optimize the Parameters Using Gradient Descent:
- The gradient descent algorithm updates the weights \(w\) and bias \(b\) to minimize the cost function.
- **Update rule**:
  \[
  w := w - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial w}
  \]
  \[
  b := b - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial b}
  \]
- The learning rate \(\alpha\) controls how big a step is taken during each iteration.
- The partial derivatives for linear regression:
  \[
  \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}_i - y_i) \cdot x_i
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)
  \]

## 6. Repeat the Update Until Convergence:
- Repeat the gradient descent steps for a fixed number of iterations or until the cost function value stops changing significantly.

## 7. Predict:
- Once the model is trained, use the learned parameters \(w\) and \(b\) to make predictions on new data by plugging in the values into the hypothesis function.

## 8. Evaluate the Model:
- Use metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, or \(R^2\) (**Coefficient of Determination**) to assess the model's performance on the test set.
